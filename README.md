# Hate Speech Detection

This repository contains code and notebooks for detecting hate speech using machine learning techniques. The project demonstrates data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, all within Jupyter Notebooks.



## Introduction

Hate speech detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) aimed at identifying and mitigating harmful online content. This project explores various approaches to classify text as hate speech or not, leveraging labeled datasets and popular machine learning algorithms.



## Getting Started

## ðŸ’¡ Overview

- **Objective**: Detect hate speech in social media comments using advanced NLP techniques.
- **Models Used**: Fine-tuned transformer models including BERT, HateBERT, and RoBERTa.
- **Dataset**: Reddit-based annotated datasets with varying preprocessing techniques.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.


## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- Python
- HuggingFace Transformers
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
- Optuna (for hyperparameter tuning)
- Pandas & NumPy



### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended: create a virtual environment
